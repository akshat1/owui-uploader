# Project-specific instructions for Cursor AI

## Testing
- Using Node's built-in test runner (node --test)
- Coverage reporting with c8
- Run tests with: yarn test
- Run coverage with: yarn coverage

## Code Style
- Using untranspiled JavaScript (ES modules)
- No Babel or TypeScript
- Follow Node.js native module patterns

## Project Structure
- Main application code in app/ directory
- Tests co-located with source files (e.g., api.js and api.test.js)

## Dependencies
- Using yarn as package manager
- Minimal dependencies approach

## Development Workflow
- Write tests first (TDD approach)
- Use Node's native test assertions
